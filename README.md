# My Learning Posts

Development and learning development is an exciting journey that constantly changes. In fact, from the time that I started building this site to the time that it is deployed

While I have been coding in various languages over the last 6 years, I've only been pursuing a career as a developer for the last year and a half.

In my life, I've not done anything that I've been as passionate about as I have been about javascript, react and development as a whole.

One thing that I've noticed about really good developers is that they constantly take notes on what they are learning. It is hard to keep track of everything, even if you constantly use the skills you are using.

It is my goal with this blog to keep track of what I am learning. Each week, I will spend a day reflecting on what I have learned over the previous week. Typically it will be on a particular subject. I'll collect my notes into a summary, share code examples, resources, chapter summaries in coding books I'm reading, tweets from thought leaders, etc.

For the first post I write, I will be writing about some of the things that have inspired me to start this site.

My masters in finance and my job as a litigation consultant made my research skills particularly top notch. They have helped me to dig around and find some amazing developers to learn from. One of the reasons I know that I am in the right field (finally) is that I recently recognized the kind of happiness that my wife gets from reading Harry Potter is the kind of enjoyment that I get from reading about and writing code.
