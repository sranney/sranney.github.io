                It goes without say that learning new technology can be quite overwhelming.

                There are seemingly an endless number of them first of all. Second, the rate at which technology changes means that as you master one thing, it could potentially become "out of date." Even worse, what you are learning could become obsolete. But, as soon as you look at job descriptions, you see experience required on a whole bunch of technologies that, if you blinked your eyes, you may not even know what they are, why they exist or what problem they were made to solve. So, you panick, thinking, there's no way I'll be able to keep up with the Jones's. You don't want to become obsolete, to become a dinosaur, so you think, okay, let's try to figure out what I need to learn. But if you are anything like I used to be, looking at job descriptions can swell that anxiety up again. Some jobs want PHP. Some jobs want 10 years of React experience (haha). Other jobs want a plethora of other things. A whole bunch of technology is out there.

                As engineers, we spend a lot of time thinking about "Why?" Because of the opportunity costs of investing your time in learning new technology, you've got to ask a few questions. 
            </PostPar>
            <PostPar underline>
                What is your motivation in spending your time learning this instead of doing other things you enjoy? What purpose do you have in investing in learning technology?

            <PostPar>
                These questions are so important to answer, and can be a reminder for the really hard days.

                For me, the answer to that question really boils down to a few things.

                Often times, development is what I want to spend my time doing above a lot of other things. Writing code. Thinking about application design. Taking an idea, just a thought, and turning it into something that I can see and interact with, that is alive. Development is a level of creativity I have not found in anything else. It is an art. When I wrote my first application, I knew that this was the right field for me.

                "If you want to do something, don't just put the bare minimum effort into. Work hard at it." This is how I was raised. The ultimate outcome for this way of thinking for me has played out in the following way:  It's okay if I don't want to spend the time in doing something... it might just not interest me that much. But, if I truly want something, I am worth investing the effort into to achieve that thing. Additionally, I have hope that challenges I face, I can overcome. As a junior developer, I face
