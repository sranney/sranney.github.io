            <p className='body'>Welcome to my learning journal site</p>
            <p className='body'>I am a developer seeking to learn as much as I can about my profession. I love development. It is one of my passions. I am still relatively young in this field, and have a lot that I still want to learn. I seek to achieve two goals by creating this site. First, to write thorough articles on subjects I'm learning. That will help me understand where my gaps in knowledge are, and will help me keep my notes organized. Second, to help other developers through my own self study.</p>
            <p className='body'>Every week, I will be posting a write up about either something I learned over the previous week, or something that's been on my mind that I want to write about. Patterns and concepts, new syntax, the bigger picture, etc.</p>
            <p className='body'>Eventually, it is my goal to build this site out more and interview developers that I admire. One of the things that I love about the industry I work in is the diversity of the backgrounds of people working in the field. There are so many thought leaders and fantastic educators who are so open and want to share what they know.</p>
            <p className='body'>This is an exciting journey that I am on. Being in this field has helped make my spirit feel young. I am looking forward to all where I am headed.</p>
