            <p className='body'>Development and learning development is an exciting journey that constantly changes. In fact, from the time that I started building this site to the time that it is deployed, React Router hooks have been created! 🤯</p>
            <p className='body'>While I have been coding in various languages over the last 6 years, I've only been pursuing a career as a developer for the last year and a half.</p>
            <p className='body'>One of the reasons I know that I am in the right field (finally) is that I recently recognized the kind of happiness that my wife gets from reading Harry Potter ⚡️ is the kind of enjoyment that I get from reading about and writing code. In my life, I've not done anything that I've been as passionate about as I have been about javascript, react and development as a whole. 🎉</p>
            <p className='body'>Good developers constantly take notes 📝 on what they are learning. It is hard to keep track of everything, even if you constantly use the skills you are learning.</p>
            <p className='body'>It is my goal with this blog to keep track of what I am learning. Each week, I will spend a day reflecting on what I have learned over the previous week. Typically it will be on a single particular subject. I'll write summaries, share code examples, resources, chapter summaries in coding books 📚 I'm reading, etc.</p>
            <p className='body'>For the first post I write, I will be writing about some of the things that have inspired me to start this site, and the direction that I am taking in my learning.</p>
            <p className='body'>I am not an expert in this field. It is my desire to become the best developer I can be, and I believe this site will be one step towards that goal. I love teaching/sharing stuff I am excited about. I am so excited about this stuff, I don't want to keep what I learn to myself.</p>
