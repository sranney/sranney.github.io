            <p className='body'>Development and learning development is an exciting journey that constantly changes. In fact, from the time that I started building this site to the time that it is deployed</p>
            <p className='body'>While I have been coding in various languages over the last 6 years, I've only been pursuing a career as a developer for the last year and a half.</p>
            <p className='body'>One of the reasons I know that I am in the right field (finally) is that I recently recognized the kind of happiness that my wife gets from reading Harry Potter is the kind of enjoyment that I get from reading about and writing code. In my life, I've not done anything that I've been as passionate about as I have been about javascript, react and development as a whole.</p>
            <p className='body'>I've noticed about really good developers is that they constantly take notes on what they are learning. It is hard to keep track of everything, even if you constantly use the skills you are learning.</p>
            <p className='body'>It is my goal with this blog to keep track of what I am learning. Each week, I will spend a day reflecting on what I have learned over the previous week. Typically it will be on a particular subject. I'll collect my notes into a summary, share code examples, resources, chapter summaries in coding books I'm reading, tweets from thought leaders, etc.</p>
            <p className='body'>For the first post I write, I will be writing about some of the things that have inspired me to start this site, and the direction that I am taking in my learning.</p>
            <p className='body'>My masters in finance and my job as a litigation consultant made my research skills particularly top notch. They have helped me to dig around and find some amazing developers to learn from.</p>
            <p className='body'>I am not an expert in this field. It is my desire to become the best developer I can be, and I believe this site will be one step towards that goal. I love teaching/sharing stuff I am excited about. I am so excited about this stuff, I don't want to keep what I learn to myself.</p>
            <p className='body'>To see my dev code on this site, <a href='https://github.com/sranney/sranney.github.io/tree/develop' className='link' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a>.</p>
