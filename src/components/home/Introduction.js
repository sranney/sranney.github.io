                It goes without say that learning new technology can be quite overwhelming.

                There are seemingly an endless number of them first of all. Second, the rate at which technology changes means that as you master one thing, it could potentially become "out of date." Even worse, what you are learning could become obsolete. But, as soon as you look at job descriptions, you see experience required on a whole bunch of technologies that, if you blinked your eyes, you may not even know what they are, why they exist or what problem they were made to solve. So, you panick, thinking, there's no way I'll be able to keep up with the Jones's. You don't want to become obsolete, to become a dinosaur, so you think, okay, let's try to figure out what I need to learn. But if you are anything like I used to be, looking at job descriptions can swell that anxiety up again. Some jobs want PHP. Some jobs want 10 years of React experience (haha). Other jobs want a plethora of other things. A whole bunch of technology is out there.

                As engineers, we spend a lot of time thinking about "Why?" Because of the opportunity costs of investing your time in learning new technology, you've got to ask a few questions. 
            </PostPar>
            <PostPar underline>
                What is your motivation in spending your time learning this instead of doing other things you enjoy? What purpose do you have in investing in learning technology?
            </PostPar>
            <PostPar>
                These questions are so important to answer honestly starting out, and can be a reminder why you are doing this for the days that are particularly hard.
            </PostPar>
            <PostPar>
                For me, the answer to that question really boils down to a few things.

                Often times, development is what I want to spend my time doing above a lot of other things. Writing code. Thinking about application design. Taking an idea, just a thought, and turning it into something that I can see and interact with, that is alive. Development is a level of creativity I have not found in anything else. It is an art. When I wrote my first application, I knew that this was the right field for me.

                "If you want to do something, work hard for it." This is how I was raised. The ultimate outcome for this way of thinking for me has played out in the following way:  If I truly want something, I am worth investing the effort into to achieve that thing. Over the years, I have grown a hope that I can overcome challenges I face. I love challenges, and view them as growth opportunities.
            </PostPar>
            <PostPar>
                Because I love growth opportunities and I love development, I spend a lot of time becoming a better engineer. I seek out the areas that I am not strong in, and figure out how I can get better.
            </PostPar>
            <PostPar>
                What I have just described - the hope of being able to accomplish things when faced with challenges - is a critical component in learning new technology or trying to become a developer.

                I largely agree with what the study and Tejas are explaining. Hope of overcoming is very important to have in everything. However, I disagree with what is being expressed as reality. I have seen firsthand that I overcome my challenges. With just effort and perseverance, not delusional thinking, you can overcome challenges and achieve what you want. How many challenges have you overcome? What did you do to overcome those challenges? Can you apply that same principal to  Reality truly is closer to optimism in this instance. Fear and doubt, especially when it comes to learning how to code, are lies and they generate pessimism. In my opinion, that's closer to a delusion.

                You can do this. It will take time and hard work, but you can do this. You just need a strategy!
