Context API makes it so that you can more easily colocate state with UI. And with useContext hook and custom hooks, now we also don\'t have the issue of wrapper hell. So optimized, more declarative which is easier to understand, and component tree is less cluttered. It\'s no wonder to me that a lot of people are releasing new hooks seemingly every day.
